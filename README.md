# execute-bash-open-webui
A tool plugin written in Python for open-webui that allows the full execution of bash cmds &amp; scripts without external dependencies.

This tool allows you to execute any and all bash commands and bash scripts without restriction. There are no external dependencies. It is strongly recommended to use this only if running open-webui in a container, and/or you know bash well enough not to run silly commands. 

Accepts direct input such as "run ls" or "echo open-webui is awesome!" along with generic terms like "list files" or "print open-webui is awesome!" -- although results may vary slightly with the latter depending on the model used. 

Reasoning model is recommended, but entirely optional.

I don't plan to maintain this for long after I've added valve functionality, but feel free to contribute and keep it active, or fork it.
